### Version History

#### 1.0.1 | 4/25/2022
- Refactored ```checkBoardForVictory()``` to specifically check for the row/column/diagonal in which a new token is placed
- Removed the now-irrelevant array, line[], which was being instantiated/populated/overwritten during every round and checked in a secondary function to verify that it was filled with exclusively the playerâ€™s tokens
- Removed loops which checked over the entire board, instead of specifically relevant lines

#### 1.0.0
- Initial release
